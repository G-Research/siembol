# How to use the management page

The management page can only be accessed by an admin of any service. It has two sections: one with management links and one with various actions.

## Links
The management links are links useful to only admins. This could for example be a link to monitoring dashboards. To add management links see [here](./how_to_add_links_to_siembol_ui_home_page.md).

## Actions
Currently there is only one admin action: managing the running applications. This opens up a dialog which is explained in detail [here](./how_to_manage_applications.md).
