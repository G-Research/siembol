# How to add links to the siembol ui home page
The siembol home page has an 'Explore Siembol' section at the button of its home page, as can be seen in the screenshot below. It is used for quick access to useful resources such as documentation, ticket tracking systems etc. By default there is a link to the documentation and to the issues page on the git repo.

New links can be added from the `ui-config.json` config file. 
Below is the default config file provided where the two default links are in "homeLinks". 

        {
            "environment": "demo",
            "serviceRoot": "https://config-editor/",
            "uiBootstrapPath": "./ui-bootstrap.json",
            "authType": "disabled",
            "homeLinks": [
                {
                    "icon": "library_books",
                    "title": "Documentation",
                    "link": "https://github.com/G-Research/siembol/tree/master/docs"
                },
                {   
                    "icon": "live_help",
                    "title": "Issues",
                    "link":  "https://github.com/G-Research/siembol/issues"}
                ]
        }



To add a new link you need three things:
- the url to which the user will be redirected on clicking the link
- the icon to be displayed; this has to be the name of a material icon (you can find them all here: https://material.io/)
- the title to display below the icon
