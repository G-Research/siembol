# Siembol Response Service
## Overview
Siembol response is a service for defining a response to an alert. It brings a functionality: 
- To integrate siembol with other systems such as jira, ldap, elk, the hive, cortex etc.
- Enriching the alert with possibility of filtering it in order to speed up the incident response process and to reduce false positives
- Supporting alert throttling to reduce noise from alerts that are usually triggered in a bulk of alerts
- The pluggable interface allows to  easily develop and integrate a plugin with custom evaluators if needed

## Siembol Response Rule 
### Evaluation
The rules are ordered and evaluated similarly to firewall table - first match will stop further evaluation. Each rule can return 
- `match` - The alert was matched by the rule and the evaluation of the alert has been finished
- `no_match` - The alert was not matched by the rule and the next rule in the list will be evaluated
- `filtered` - - The alert was filtered by the rule and the evaluation of the alert has been finished

A rule contains a list of evaluators which are evaluated during the rule evaluation. An evaluator can return the same values as a rule - `match`, `no_match`, `filtered`. A rule returns `match` if all its evaluators return `match`, see
![response evaluation diagram](images/response_evaluation.svg)

### Response Rule 
- `rule_name` - Rule name that uniquely identifies the rule
- `rule_author` - The author of the rule - the user who last modified the rule
- `rule_version` - The version of the rule
- `rule_description` - This field contains a single text input that allows you set a description for the alert. This should be a short, helpful comment that allows anyone to identify the purpose of this rule
- `evaulators` - The list of evaluators for the rule evaluation. Each evaluator contains:
    - `evaluator_type` - The type of the response evaluator
    - `evaluator_attributes` - The attributes of the evaluator

### Provided evaluators
#### Fixed result
Fixed evaluator always returns evaluation result from its attributes.
- `evaluator_type` - The type equals to `fixed_result`
- `evaluator_attributes`
    -`evaluation_result` - The evaluation result returned by the evaluator

#### Matching
Matching evaluator evaluates its matchers and returns evaluation result from its attributes.
- `evaluator_type` - The type equals to `matching`
- `evaluator_attributes`
    - `evaluation_result` - The evaluation result returned by the evaluator after matching from `match`, `filtered`, `filtered_when_no_match`
    - `matchers` - You can add as many matchers as you want.
        - `is_enabled` - The matcher is enabled
        - `description` - The description of the matcher
        - `matcher_type` - Type of matcher, either `REGEX_MATCH` or `IS_IN_SET`
        - `is_negated`- The matcher is negated
        - `field` - The name of the field on which the matcher will be evaluated

There are two types of matchers:
- `REGEX_MATCH` - A regex_match allows you use a regex statement to match a specified field. There are two string inputs:
    - `data` - The regex statement in [Java data time formatter syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html) except allowing to use underscores in the names of captured groups Named capture groups in the regex are added as fields in the event. They are available from the next matcher onwards and are included in the output event

- `IS_IN_SET` - It compares the value of a field to a set of strings defined in `data`. If the value is in the set then the matcher returns true. 
    - `data` - A list of strings to compare the value to. New line delimited. Does not support regex - each line must be a literal match however, field substitution is supported in this field

  - `result_if_not_excluded` - Evaluation result from `no_match` or `match` that the evaluator returns if the alert is not excluded

## Plugins
Siembol response plugins allows to extend the functionality of siembol response by integrating custom evaluators if needed. A response plugin can contain one or more evaluators and siembol response can load one or more plugins if needed.

### Plugin architecture
A Siembol response plugin is a shaded jar file that includes all its dependencies see [how to write response plugin](how-tos/how_to_write_response_plugin.md). The plugins can be copied in a directory where they will be loaded by the [springboot properties launcher](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-executable-jar-format.html) The plugin is also integrated into siembol UI and its evaluators can be used in the similar way as the ones provided directly by siembol response.
