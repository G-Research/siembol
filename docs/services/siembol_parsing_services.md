# Siembol Parsing Services
## Overview
Siembol provides parsing services for normalising logs into messages with one layer of key/value pairs. Clean normalised data is very important for further processing such as alerting.
### Key concepts
- `Parser` is a siembol configuration that defines how to normalise a log 
- `Parsing app` is a stream application (storm topology) that combines one or multiple parsers, reads logs from kafka topics and produces normalised logs to output kafka topics
### Common fields
These common fields are included in all siembol messages after parsing:
- `original_string` - The original log before normalisation
- `timestamp` - Timestamp extracted from the log in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch
- `source_type` - Data source - the siembol parser that was used for parsing the log 
- `guid` - Unique identification of the message
## Parser config
The configuration defines how the log is normalised
- `parser_name` - Name of the parser
- `parser_version` - Version of the parser
- `parser_author` - Author of the parser
- `parser_description`- Description of the parser
### Parser Attributes
- `parser_type` - The type of the parser
    - Netflow v9 parser - parses a netflow payload and produces a list of normalised messages. Netflow v9 parsing is based on templates and the parser is learning templates while parsing messages.
    - Generic parser - Creates two fields
        - `original_string` - The log copied from the input
        - `timestamp` - Current epoch time of parsing in milliseconds. This timestamp can be overwritten in further parsing
    - Syslog Parser
        - `syslog_version` - Expected version of the syslog message - `RFC_3164`, `RFC_5424`, `RFC_3164, RFC_5424`
        - `merge_sd_elements` - Merge SD elements of the syslog message into one parsed object
        - `time_formats` - Time formats used for time formatting. Syslog default time formats are used if not provided 
        - `timezone` - Time zone used in syslog default time formats
### Parser Extractors
Extractors are used for further extracting and normalising parts of the message. 
![parser_flow](images/parser_flow.svg)
#### Overview
An extractor reads an input field and produces the set of key value pairs extracted from the field. Each extractor is called in the chain and its produced messages are merged into the parsed message after finishing the extraction. This way the next extractor in the chain can use the outputs of the previous ones. If the input field of the extractor is not part of the parsed message then its execution is skipped and the next one in the chain is called. A preprocessing function of the extractor is called before the extraction in order to normalise and clean the input field. Post-processing functions are called on extractor outputs in order to normalise its output messages.
#### Common extractor attributes
- `is_enabled` - The extractor is enabled
- `description` - The description of the extractor
- `name` - The name of the extractor
- `field` - The field on which the extractor is applied
- `pre_processing_function` - The pre-processing function applied before the extraction
    - `string_replace` - Replace the first occurrence of `string_replace_target` by `string_replace_replacement` 
    - `string_replace_all` - Replace all occurrences of `string_replace_target` by `string_replace_replacement`. You can use a regular expression in `string_replace_target`
- `post_processing_functions` - The list of post-processing functions applied after the extractor
    - `convert_unix_timestamp` - Convert `timestamp_field` in unix epoch timestamp in seconds to milliseconds 
    - `format_timestamp` - Convert `timestamp_field` using `time_formats` 
        - `validation_regex` - validation regular expression for checking format of the timestamp, if there is no match the next formatter from the list is tried
        - `time_format` using syntax from [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html)
        - `timezone` - Time zone used by the time formatter
    - `convert_to_string` - Convert all extracted fields as strings except fields from the list `conversion_exclusions`
- `extractor_type` - The extractor type - one from `pattern_extractor`, `key_value_extractor`, `csv_extractor`, `json_extractor` 
- flags
    - `should_overwrite_fields` - Extractor should overwrite an existing field with the same name, otherwise it creates a new field with the prefix `duplicate`
    - `should_remove_field` - Extractor should remove input field after extraction
    - `remove_quotes` - Extractor removes quotes in the extracted values
    - `skip_empty_values` - Extractor will remove empty strings after the extraction
    - `thrown_exception_on_error`- Extractor throws an exception on error (recommended for testing), otherwise it skips the further processing
#### Pattern extractor
Extracting key value pairs by matching a list of regular expressions with named-capturing groups, where names of the groups are used for naming fields. Siembol supports syntax from [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) except allowing to use underscores in the names of captured groups
- `regular_expressions` - The list of regular expressions 
- `dot_all_regex_flag` - The regular expression `.` matches any character - including a line terminator
- `should_match_pattern` - At least one pattern should match otherwise the extractor throws an exception
#### Key value Extractor
Key value extractor extracts values from the field which has the form `key1=value1 ... keyN=valueN`
 - `word_delimiter`- Word delimiter used for splitting words, by default ` `
 - `key_value_delimiter`- Key-value delimiter used for splitting key value pairs, by default `=`;
 - `escaped_character`- Character for escaping quotes, delimiters, brackets, by default `\\`;
 - `quota_value_handling` - Handling quotes during parsing
 - `next_key_strategy` - Strategy for key value extraction where key-value delimiter is found first and then the word delimiter is searched backward
 - `escaping_handling` - Handling escaping during parsing
#### CSV extractor
- `column_names` - Specification for selecting column names, where `skipping_column_name` is a name that can be used to not include a column with this name in the parsed message
- `word_delimiter` - Word delimiter used for splitting words 
#### Json Extractor
Json extractor extracts valid json message and unfolds json into flat json key value pairs.
- `path_prefix` - The prefix added to the extracted field names after json parsing
- `nested_separator` - The separator added during unfolding of nested json objects
#### Json Path Extractor
Json Path extractor evaluates json path queries on the input field and stores their results. Siembol supports `dot` and `bracket` notation using syntax from [https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath#readme](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath#readme) 
- `at_least_one_query_result` - At least one query should store its result otherwise the extractor throws an exception
- `json_path_queries` - List of json path queries, where a json path `query` is evaluated and stored in `output_field` on success
### Parser Transformations
#### Overview
All key value pairs generated by parsers and extractors can be modified by a chain of transformations. This stage allows the parser to clean data by renaming fields, removing fields or even filtering the whole message. 
#### Common fields
Common transformation fields:
- `is_enabled` - The transformation is enabled
- `description` - The description of the transformation

#### field name string replace
Replace the first occurrence of `string_replace_target` in field names by `string_replace_replacement`

#### field name string replace all
Replace all occurrences of `string_replace_target` by `string_replace_replacement`. You can use a regular expression in `string_replace_target`
#### field name string delete all
Delete all occurrences of `string_replace_target`. You can use a regular expression in `string_replace_target`
#### field name change case
Change case in all field names to `case_type`
#### rename fields
Rename fields according to mapping in `field_rename_map`, where you specify pairs of `field_to_rename`, `new_name`
#### delete fields
Delete fields according to the filter in `fields_filter`, where you specify the lists of patterns for `including_fields`, `excluding_fields`
#### trim value
Trim values in the fields according to the filter in `fields_filter`, where you specify the lists of patterns for `including_fields`, `excluding_fields`
#### lowercase value

#### filter message
Filter logs that are matching the `message_filter`, where `matchers` are specified for filtering.
## Parsing application
